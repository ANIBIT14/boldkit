## [3.3.9] — 2026-05-29 — Next.js + Tailwind v4 compatibility

Three install-time bugs reported against v3.3.8 — all in the path between BoldKit's docs/registry and a fresh Next.js + Tailwind v4 + shadcn project. None affect existing Vite users.

### Highlights

🩹 **`import.meta.env.DEV` no longer breaks Next.js builds** (#8). Five components emitted Vite-only `import.meta.env.DEV` reads — fine under Vite, fatal under `next build` because Next.js does not type `ImportMeta.env`. Replaced with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` everywhere (works in both Vite and Next): React `ErrorBoundary`, `Tour`, `Slider`, `SankeyChart`, `Invoice` block, and the Vue `ErrorBoundary` (hoisted to an `isDev` const so the template binding stays SSR-safe). Registry JSONs regenerated.

🩹 **Theme Builder now emits a Tailwind v4 `@theme` bridge** (#7). The generator at `/theme-builder` shipped only `:root { --background: 60 9% 98%; }` etc. — raw HSL channels with no `--color-*` mapping. Pasted into a Tailwind v4 + shadcn project that expects `--color-background: var(--background)`, the utilities resolved to `background-color: 60 9% 98%` (invalid). Generator now prepends a full `@theme { --color-background: hsl(var(--background)); … }` block matching the shipped registry styles, plus the `--radius-sm/md/lg/xl` shorthands. Every preset funnels through `generateCSS()`, so all themes inherit the fix.

🩹 **Registry alias docs use the `{name}.json` template** (#9). shadcn 4.x requires the templated item URL in the `registries` map — BoldKit's install docs showed `"@boldkit": "https://boldkit.dev/r"` (and Vue `…/r/vue`), which fails to resolve `@boldkit/button`. Updated Installation page, Introduction page (both copy-buttons), and README to:
- React: `https://boldkit.dev/r/{name}.json`
- Vue: `https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/{name}.json`

### Internals

- `tsconfig.app.json` now includes `"node"` in `types` and adds `@types/node` to devDeps — required so the new `process.env.NODE_ENV` reads type-check under BoldKit's own `tsc -b`. Downstream Next.js users already have these via Next.

### Bumps

- React: `3.3.8 → 3.3.9`
- Vue: `3.1.8 → 3.1.9`

## [3.3.8] — 2026-05-29 — Registry recheck + chart family fix

A follow-up stability pass after a full source-vs-registry recheck. **36 install-breakers** that were silently shipping in v3.3.7 — caught by extending the audit script to cover relative imports, fixed in this release.

### Highlights

🩹 **React chart family is installable.** All 9 standalone chart entries (`donut-chart`, `radar-chart`, `radial-bar-chart`, `gauge-chart`, `sparkline`, `funnel-chart`, `treemap-chart`, `heatmap-chart`, `sankey-chart`) shipped with install targets at `components/ui/chart/<name>.tsx` while their relative `./chart` import resolved to a path nothing shipped. Flattened all chart targets to `components/ui/<name>.tsx` so `./chart` correctly hits the base `chart` entry. Added missing `@boldkit/chart` registryDep to the four entries that import `./empty`.

🩹 **8 Vue entries had missing `registryDependencies` or stale file lists.** `alert-dialog`, `calendar`, `pagination` now declare `button` (each imports `./button-variants`). `toggle-group` declares `toggle`. `dropzone` declares `progress` + `spinner`. `stat-card` declares `card` + `progress`. `empty-state` and `layered-card` now ship their `-variants.ts` sibling. `pagination` and `dropdown-menu` had stale `files:` lists referencing components that don't exist on disk — corrected.

🩹 **20 Vue shapes were missing from the registry.** `SHAPE_FILES` had drifted 20 entries behind the 55 on disk. Replaced with disk auto-discovery so any new shape ships automatically: Apple, Crescent, Decagon, Ellipse, FibonacciSpiral, Gear, Heptagon, KochSnowflake, MobiusStrip, PenroseTriangle, Planet, Rainbow, Rhombus, Seal, Star6, Sun, Torus, Trefoil, Umbrella, WavyRectangle.

✨ **Vue parity for `ascii-shapes` and `error-boundary`.** Both existed on the React side but had no Vue install path. ASCII Shapes now ship all 17 components + constants via a new subdirectory codepath. ErrorBoundary now has a Vue equivalent using `onErrorCaptured` with the same neubrutalism fallback UI; published as `r/vue/error-boundary.json`.

✨ **New `/components/error-boundary` docs page.** Framework-switched preview/code/install with a live "Trigger error" demo button. Sidebar entry + Installation page entry added.

🐛 **Blocks page no longer shows broken install commands.** All 15 block cards were displaying `npx shadcn add boldkit.dev/r/<block>.json` commands that 404'd — the block registry entries don't exist (blocks remain copy/paste-grade). Removed the install bar UI. Each block doc page now has React + Vue "View on GitHub" source links via a new `sourcePaths` prop on `BlockDoc`.

### Internals — new permanent guard

`scripts/audit-registry-imports.mjs` was previously blind to relative imports — only checked `from '@/...'` aliases. Extended to resolve `from './x'` and `from '../x'` against each file's install target, verifying the resolved path is shipped by the same entry or by a declared registryDependency. That single change exposed all 36 issues above in one audit run.

### Bumps

- `package.json`: 3.3.7 → 3.3.8
- `packages/vue/package.json`: 3.1.7 → 3.1.8
- README badge: 3.3.7 → 3.3.8

---

## [3.3.7] — 2026-05-26 — Registry health pass

A focused stability release that fixes install-time failures consumers have been hitting and adds permanent guards so the same classes of bug can't silently return.

### Highlights

🩹 **`@boldkit/*` install path now works end-to-end.** Cross-component deps (`button`, `utils`, `math-curves`, etc.) were resolving against shadcn's default registry instead of BoldKit's. All 74 references across React + Vue are now properly scoped.

🩹 **Vue `math-curve-*` family is installable.** `MathCurveLoader`, `MathCurveProgress`, `MathCurveBackground`, and the shared `math-curves` engine were missing from `shadcn-vue` entirely. Now registered.

🩹 **Chart components ship current source.** React chart-X files synced from `src/components/ui/chart/` with import rewriting. Vue chart entries now bundle `ChartEmpty.vue` and `chart-types.ts` so installs compile.

🩹 **37 UI mirrors caught up with `src/`.** Months of bug fixes (focus-visible, ARIA attrs, edge cases) and security helpers (`safeHref`, `sanitizeCssValue`) had never reached the registry. `rating.tsx` registry was an entirely different implementation from src.

✨ **Two new `MathCurveLoader` curves.** `spiral` and `heart`, both already in the runtime — TypeScript just needed widening.

🐛 **`/components/sidebar` no longer crashes.** Active-state demo was missing its `<SidebarProvider>` wrapper.

### ⚠️ Required setup (positive break)

Add the `@boldkit` alias to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@boldkit": "https://boldkit.dev/r"
  }
}
```

(Vue: `https://boldkit.dev/r/vue`.)

Then install components as:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @boldkit/button @boldkit/card
# or for Vue
npx shadcn-vue@latest add @boldkit/button @boldkit/card
```

Single-file installs of leaf items (`utils`, `styles`) still work via direct URL, but **any component with cross-deps requires the alias.**

### Internals — drift can't recur

New `scripts/sync-registry-from-src.js` runs as a pre-step in `registry:build`. It copies `src/components/ui/*.tsx` and selected libs into `registry/default/` and self-verifies — if any in-scope mirror still drifts after sync, the build fails. This protects against the silent-drift class of bug going forward.

### Commits

- `2f68fd1` registry: scope cross-references with `@boldkit/` namespace
- `86397c2` registry+docs: finish scoping pass, fix build order, update install docs
- `9b70d71` registry: migrate 6 hand-written Vue entries into build script
- `2c016b0` math-curves: add `spiral` + `heart` to `LoaderCurveKey`
- `f9151fa` registry: close Vue math-curve gap + sync 37 drifted React mirrors
- `b74270f` registry: chart family drift — sync React, complete Vue bundling
- `de251ec` docs: wrap Active State sidebar demo in `SidebarProvider`

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-05-05

### ✨ New Components

**Combobox (React + Vue)**
- New `Combobox` component built by composing `Popover` and `Command` — searchable, filterable dropdown with neubrutalism styling
- `ComboboxTrigger` — single-select trigger with thick border, hard shadow, and press-down focus effect
- `ComboboxMultiTrigger` — multi-select trigger with removable tag chips; `values` prop accepts `{ value, label }[]` and `onRemove` (React) / `@remove` (Vue) returns the item's `value` directly (no reverse-lookup needed)
- `ComboboxContent` — popover wrapper with `align="start"` default so the dropdown left-aligns with the trigger
- Re-exports all `Command*` sub-components as `Combobox*` aliases (`ComboboxInput`, `ComboboxList`, `ComboboxEmpty`, `ComboboxGroup`, `ComboboxItem`, `ComboboxSeparator`)
- Installable via shadcn CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/combobox.json"` (React) / `npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/combobox.json"` (Vue)
- Full documentation page at `/components/combobox` with 5 examples: Basic, Multi Select, With Groups, With Label, Disabled
- Added to sidebar navigation, Cmd+K search, and sitemap

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Vue Templates**
- `DocsTemplate.vue` — Added `aria-live="polite"` region so screen readers announce "Copied to clipboard" when copy button is clicked

---

## [3.2.3] — 2026-05-02

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**React Core UI**
- `badge.tsx` — Renders as inline `<span>` instead of block `<div>` (fixes layout in inline contexts)
- `input-otp.tsx` — Added bounds check on `slots[index]` in `InputOTPSlot` — no longer crashes when index is out of range or used outside `OTPInput` context
- `stepper.tsx` — `StepperContent` now has `aria-labelledby` pointing to its corresponding `StepperTrigger` (ARIA tab panel pattern)
- `stepper.tsx` — `StepperTrigger` gets a stable `id` for the labelledby association
- `tree-view.tsx` — Renamed internal `TreeNode` function component to `TreeNodeItem` to eliminate confusion with the exported `TreeNode` interface

**Charts**
- `chart/legend.tsx` — React keys in `ChartLegendContent` now use `dataKey ?? value ?? index` — prevents duplicate key warnings when two series share a label
- `chart/donut-chart.tsx` — `foreignObject` center label now sizes proportionally to `innerRadius` instead of hardcoded `100×60`
- `chart/radial-bar-chart.tsx` — `stacked` variant is now functional — uses `stackId="stack"` on `<RadialBar>` so bars stack angularly in the same track
- `chart/sankey-chart.tsx` — Removed unused `totalVal` variable and `void totalVal` suppressor (dead code)
- `chart/treemap-chart.tsx` — Fixed `Tooltip` `formatter` type annotation to match Recharts' actual `ValueType`
- `math-curve-background.tsx` — Removed `strokeOpacity={0.15}` from the inner `<path>` — was multiplying with the SVG-level `opacity` prop making curves nearly invisible (0.15 × 0.15 = 0.022)
- `math-curve-progress.tsx` — Progress head rotation now uses CSS `style.transform` + `transformBox: fill-box` instead of SVG `transform` attribute — CSS transitions now actually animate

**Shapes**
- `shapes.tsx` — Clamped inner `strokeWidth` to `Math.max(1, strokeWidth - 2)` — no more zero/negative stroke values
- `shapes.tsx` — Added `aria-hidden="true"` to all 55 SVG shape components (decorative SVGs no longer announced by screen readers)
- `ascii-shapes.tsx` — Fixed `drawTorus` B-rotation z-component: `oz2` was incorrectly set to `oz1`, skipping the B-axis rotation and producing a flat torus
- `ascii-shapes.tsx` — Added `aria-hidden="true"` to ASCII art `<pre>` elements

**Blocks**
- `marquee.tsx` — `speed` prop now respected when `direction="right"` (added `animate-marquee-slow-reverse` and `animate-marquee-fast-reverse` CSS classes)
- `team-section.tsx` — Replaced deprecated `Twitter` icon with `XIcon` from lucide-react
- `team-section.tsx` — Hidden social link overlay now has `aria-hidden="true"` and links have `tabIndex={-1}` — keyboard users no longer tab through invisible links
- `footer-section.tsx` — `<Separator>` components standardised to `h-[3px]` (was `h-[2px]`, inconsistent with neubrutalism 3px border standard)
- `contact-section.tsx` — Map container no longer collapses to zero height at `lg` breakpoint (`lg:h-auto` → `lg:h-full lg:min-h-[400px]`)

**Vue (@boldkit/vue v3.1.3)**
- `Tabs.vue` — `update:modelValue` emit narrowed from `string | number` to `string`
- `Select.vue` — Removed `bigint` and `Record<string, unknown>` from `update:modelValue` emit (narrowed to `string | number | null`)
- `DropdownMenuRadioGroup.vue` — Aligned prop (`modelValue?: string | null`) with emit (`string | null`)
- `Tour.vue` — `popoverRef` explicitly typed as `Ref<HTMLDivElement | undefined>`; `totalSteps` in provided context is now a reactive `ComputedRef<number>` instead of a plain number
- `Slider.vue` — Fixed `if (animationId)` falsy check in `onUnmounted` — now uses strict `!== null` so RAF ID `0` is correctly cancelled
- `Dropzone.vue` — `maxFiles` prop is now enforced in `processFiles` — excess files are rejected with `code: 'too-many-files'` instead of silently accepted

---

## [3.2.2] — 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Canvas Effects — React & Vue (all 10 components)**
- Added `devicePixelRatio` scaling to all `resize()` functions — canvas effects are now sharp on Retina/HiDPI displays instead of blurry
- Initialized `let raf = 0` (was uninitialized `let raf: number`) across all React canvas components
- Added zero-size canvas guard to `Metaballs`, `ParticleWeb`, and `FlowField` (React + Vue) — particles no longer initialize at `(0,0)` when canvas is hidden or in a lazy container
- Fixed `React.CSSProperties` used without `React` namespace import in all 10 React canvas files — now uses `import type { CSSProperties }`
- `MatrixRain` (React + Vue) — added `background: #000` to canvas element so trail fade works on any parent background
- `MouseRipple` (React + Vue) — clamped `size = Math.max(0, 3 + ripple * 9)` to prevent negative values in `fillRect`
- `MouseRipple.vue` — replaced `_cleanup` monkey-patch on DOM node with a proper closure variable; eliminates potential `mousemove` listener leak on unmount
- `Plasma.vue` — added `palette.length < 2` guard in `colorAt()` to prevent `TypeError` crash with single-color palettes
- `Plasma.vue` — added zero-size dimension guard to `resize()` (matching React version)
- `Aurora.tsx` — reset `ctx.shadowColor = 'transparent'` after aurora bands loop to prevent shadow bleed on subsequent draw calls
- Fixed stale registry content in `public/r/plasma.json` and `public/r/vue/plasma.json` — now in sync with current source including DPR scaling and zero-size guards

**Website & UI**
- `Home.tsx` — fixed broken `<Link to="/theme-builder">` (route doesn't exist); corrected to `/themes`
- `Home.tsx` — wrapped `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` in try/catch to handle non-HTTPS / unsupported browsers
- `Home.tsx` — fixed `React.CSSProperties` without `React` import
- `Home.tsx` — `DotMatrixPreview` interval now skips updates when tab is hidden
- `Home.tsx` — copy button `setTimeout` stored in ref and cleared on re-click to avoid stale state updates
- `Header.tsx` — mobile menu (`role="dialog"`) now closes on `Escape` key press
- `Header.tsx` — added keyboard focus trap to mobile menu (ARIA dialog pattern)
- `Header.tsx` — fixed `React.CSSProperties` without `React` import
- `App.tsx` — unknown `/docs/*` paths now redirect to `/docs` instead of silently rendering Introduction
- `App.tsx` — moved `<Toaster />` inside `<BrowserRouter>` for correct provider nesting
- `Footer.tsx` — fixed stat card right-border logic at 2-column mobile breakpoint (was creating dangling border on 3rd item)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — hero install/import copy buttons now use the actual `installLine`/`importLine` values instead of hardcoded Aurora strings
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — "08 More Effects" divider count is now dynamic (`GRID.length`)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — Aurora `reactCode`/`vueCode` now includes all 5 colors (was missing `#00dceb`)
- `CanvasEffects.tsx` — each effect card now has `id={effect.id}` for hash-based deep linking
- `SearchCommand.tsx` — canvas effects now navigate to hash anchors (e.g. `/canvas-effects#aurora`) instead of all linking to the same `/canvas-effects` URL
- `SearchCommand.tsx` — `<kbd>` shortcut hint now has `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader double-announcement

**Build**
- `scripts/build-registry.js` — now processes `public/r/vue/` subdirectory and outputs stripped registry files to `public/vue/` (was silently skipping all Vue registry files)

---

## [3.1.1] — 2026-04-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-16

### ✨ ASCII Shapes — 12 animated ASCII art components

The headline feature of 3.1.0. A complete ASCII animation engine built from scratch — no canvas, no WebGL, just text characters rendered with real 3D math.

**5 three-dimensional shapes** rendered using perspective projection, z-buffering, and Lambertian shading:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AsciiTorus` | Rotating torus — X+Y axes, tube R1=1.0, ring R2=2.2 |
| `AsciiDonut` | Classic [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) — X+Z axes, fatter tube R1=1.2 |
| `AsciiSphere` | Globe with rotating lat/lon grid texture and dark side |
| `AsciiCube` | Solid cube with back-face culling and per-face shading |
| `AsciiHelix` | DNA double helix — two parametric strands with connecting rungs |

**7 generative 2D animations** drawn directly into a character grid each frame:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AsciiSpiral` | Archimedean spiral arms rotating continuously |
| `AsciiRose` | Rose curve r=cos(5θ) blooming and phase-shifting |
| `AsciiWave` | Multi-frequency sine interference scrolling left→right |
| `AsciiVortex` | Rotating density field collapsing toward center |
| `AsciiPulse` | Concentric rings expanding outward and fading |
| `AsciiMatrix` | Characters raining downward per column |
| `AsciiGrid` | Grid intersections pulsing with traveling waves |

**Shared prop API** (all 12 components):

```tsx
<AsciiTorus
  size="md"          // 'sm' (24×12) | 'md' (48×24) | 'lg' (72×36) | 'hero' (120×60)
  charset="blocks"   // 'blocks' | 'braille' | 'classic' | 'line' | 'dots'
  speed="normal"     // 'slow' (0.4×) | 'normal' (1×) | 'fast' (2.2×)
  color="#e74c3c"    // any CSS color; ignored when multicolor=true
  multicolor         // cycles primary→secondary→accent→warning→info→success per row
  animated={false}   // static first frame — no RAF, fully SSR-safe
/>
```

**Framework support:**
- React — full animated + static
- Vue 3 — full animated + static (`isMounted` guard prevents SSR RAF calls)
- Nuxt — `animated={false}` works without `<ClientOnly>`; animated variants need `<ClientOnly>` to avoid hydration mismatch

**Install:**
```bash
# React
npx shadcn@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/ascii-shapes.json"

# Vue 3 / Nuxt
npx shadcn-vue@latest add "https://boldkit.dev/r/vue/ascii-shapes.json"
```

**New pages:**
- `/ascii-shapes` — interactive showcase with live controls (charset, size, color picker, multicolor toggle)
- `/components/ascii-shapes` — full docs with 8 example sections, React + Vue code tabs, props table

---

### 📐 Math Curves — 7 new curves (15 total)

Added to `MathCurveLoader`, `MathCurveProgress`, and `MathCurveBackground`:

| New Curve | Formula |
|-----------|---------|

| `deltoid` | 3-cusped hypocycloid |
| `nephroid` | 2-cusped epicycloid (R=2, r=1) |
| `epicycloid` | General epicycloid |
| `superellipse` | Lamé curve with n=2.5 |
| `triskelion` | 3-armed rotational spiral |
| `involute` | Involute of a circle |

Previously 8 curves, now **15 total**. All doc pages updated to showcase the full set.
